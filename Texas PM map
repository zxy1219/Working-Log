Create the PM maps

1. Split thiessen grids
The Texas map is made of 688920 1-km grids. Too much computation load if the 688920 grids are processed at the same time. I decided to split them in to individual parts. Each part have 5000 1-km grids.
 

import arcpy
import os
from arcpy import env

# Set environment settings
env.workspace = "C:/data"

for i in range(0,5):
  whereclause= '"Subid" = %s' % str(i)
  arcpy.SelectLayerByAttribute_management("texas_thiessen_albers_final", "NEW_SELECTION", whereclause)
  arcpy.CopyFeatures_management("texas_thiessen_albers_final", Output path + file root name +str(i) + ".shp")
