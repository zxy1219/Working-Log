Create the PM maps

1. Split thiessen grids
The Texas map is made of 688920 1-km grids. Too much computation load if the 688920 grids are processed at the same time. I decided to split them in to individual parts. Each part have 5000 1-km grids.
 
  a. Open the attribute table, add a field called "Subid"
  b. Use "Field Calculator", give the "Subid" a number. The equation is Subid = Abs(FID/5000)
